# VisualStudioConfigs
A collection of configuration files for importing into Visual Studio 2022.

# Usage Instructions

1. Download copy of this repository as a zip file.
2. Extract all files except for README.md to your project directory.
3. Rename `visualstudio.gitignore` to `.gitignore`
4. Rename `visualstudio.editorconfig` to `.editorconfig`

Pro tip: if renaming using the windows file browser, put a period after the file name (e.g. `.gitignore.`). This allows you to rename the file to have no file extension.
